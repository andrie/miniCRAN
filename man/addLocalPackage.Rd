\title{Add local packages to a miniCRAN repository.}
\usage{
addLocalPackage(pkgs = NULL, pkgPath = NULL, path = NULL,
  type = "source", Rversion = R.version, writePACKAGES = TRUE,
  deps = FALSE, quiet = FALSE, build = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkgs}{Character vector of packages to download}

\item{pkgPath}{Character vector of directory location containing packages to
be added. Note that \code{pkgPath} should be the parent directory of the package
(i.e., the package directory path is constructed from \code{file.path(pkgPath, pkgs)}).}

\item{path}{Destination download path. This path is the root folder of your
new repository.}

\item{type}{Possible values are (currently) "source", "mac.binary" and
"win.binary": the binary types can be listed and downloaded but not
installed on other platforms.  Passed to \code{\link[=download.packages]{download.packages()}}.}

\item{Rversion}{Version of R (only used if \code{type} is not \code{source}.) Defaults to \link{R.version}, but this can be specified as any of the following formats:
\itemize{
\item a character string with the two digit R version, e.g. "3.1"
\item a list with components \code{major} and \code{minor}
\item the result of \code{\link[=getRversion]{getRversion()}}
\item the result of \code{\link[=R.version]{R.version()}}
}}

\item{writePACKAGES}{If TRUE, calls \code{\link[=write_PACKAGES]{write_PACKAGES()}} to update the
repository PACKAGES file.}

\item{deps}{logical indicating whether the package dependencies should be
added (default \code{TRUE}).}

\item{quiet}{If TRUE, suppress status messages (if any), and the progress bar
during download.}

\item{build}{Logical indicating whether packages should be build prior to
adding.}
}
\value{
Installs the packages and returns the new package index.
}
\description{
Examine the contents of a directory specified by \code{pkgPath} for pre-built
packages matching the names specified by \code{pkgs}, and add these to the
miniCRAN repository.
}
\details{
To build a package from source and then add it, use \code{build = TRUE}. Note that
package development libraries and the \code{devtools} package must be installed on
your system in order to build packages.
}
\note{
Currently, adding local packages does not check nor download their
dependencies.

\dontrun{
 addLocalPackage("myPackage", "path/to/my/prebuilt/package",

 addLocalPackage("myPackage", "path/to/my/package/sourcecode",
                 "path/to/my/miniCRAN/repo", build = TRUE)
